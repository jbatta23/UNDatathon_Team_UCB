# Description
This is our repository for the United Nations Datathon, using code accessed from both public and private datasets provided by the United Nations. We analyzed food insecurity in the following three areas: 
1. To identify food insecurity across countries, we built various machine learning models to predict overall food insecurity score.
   
2. To analyze the relationship between food insecurity and global warming, we created a heatmap and various maps to understand look at features related to global warming and food insecurity across the globe.

3. To understand the relationships between education and food insecurity, we completed exploratory data analysis to understand how food insecurity impacts education.
We targeted SDGs 2 (no hunger) 4 (quality education), and 13 (climate action).
